# A-simple-chat-bot-with-fasttext

Bots are essential for modern chat services. Text classification is the main tool for giving automated answers or answer suggestions. The big problem with text classification are languages. Luckily with fasttext we can create bots for every language. Here is a simple training and answering tool that works with every common language since fasttext is character based.
